Logistic Regression â€“ Binary Classifier

This project is part of an AI & ML Internship Task 4: Binary classification using Logistic Regression.

Objective
Build a binary classifier to classify breast cancer diagnosis (Malignant or Benign) using logistic regression.

 Dataset
- Used the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset provided in the internship.
- Target variable: `diagnosis` (M = Malignant, B = Benign)

 Tools Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

 Workflow
1. Data loading and preprocessing
2. Feature standardization
3. Logistic Regression model training
4. Evaluation using:
   - Confusion matrix
   - Precision
   - Recall
   - ROC-AUC
5. ROC Curve plotting
6. Sigmoid function explanation with plot

 Output
- Achieved high accuracy with AUC metric.
- ROC curve and sigmoid function visualized.

 Concepts Covered
- Logistic Regression
- Sigmoid Curve
- Confusion Matrix
- ROC-AUC
- Threshold Tuning
